# Comprehensive Duplicate Prevention Plan

## Problem Analysis
- Every file has exactly 4 duplicates (systematic issue)
- Current deduplication mechanisms are complex and have gaps
- Duplicates occur during service restarts and admin operations

## Multi-Layer Solution Strategy

### Layer 1: Deterministic Document IDs ✅
**Goal**: Make duplicates impossible at Solr level
**Implementation**: 
- Document ID = SHA-256(file_path + content_hash + file_size)
- Solr automatically overwrites documents with same ID
- No manual duplicate checking needed

### Layer 2: Content-Based Skipping ✅  
**Goal**: Skip processing if file hasn't changed
**Implementation**:
- Check existing document in Solr before processing
- Compare content hash + modification date
- Only process if file has actually changed

### Layer 3: Event Debouncing ✅
**Goal**: Prevent rapid-fire duplicate events
**Implementation**:
- Batch file system events within 5-second windows
- Use file modification time to detect actual changes
- Skip events for recently processed files

### Layer 4: Automatic Cleanup ✅
**Goal**: Safety net for any remaining duplicates  
**Implementation**:
- Periodic cleanup job (every 30 minutes)
- Automatic duplicate detection and removal
- Admin interface integration

### Layer 5: Single Processing Pipeline ✅
**Goal**: Eliminate race conditions completely
**Implementation**:
- Serial processing instead of parallel
- Single worker thread for metadata extraction
- Atomic queue operations

## Implementation Priority
1. **Deterministic IDs** (highest impact, prevents all duplicates)
2. **Content-based skipping** (prevents unnecessary processing)
3. **Event debouncing** (prevents source-level duplicates)
4. **Automatic cleanup** (safety net)
5. **Serial processing** (eliminates race conditions)

## Success Criteria
- Zero duplicates in Solr index
- Efficient processing (no unnecessary work)
- Robust against service restarts
- Self-healing if duplicates occur
